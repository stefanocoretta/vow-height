## Intrinsic vowel duration

## Distance to target = duration

On the distance hypothesis, see for example Turk et al 1994.

## (A) Distance hypothesis

**Full mediation** (the effect of vowel is fully mediated by F1)

## Phonologisation

::: box-note
**Phonologisation**

When the speaker gains control over a mechanical/physiological process (and the process "enters the phonetics" of the language).

(Toivonen et al. 2015)

## (B) Phonologisation hypothesis

![](images/dag-b.png){fig-align="center"}

**No mediation** (vowel and F1 independently affect duration)

## Process scattering

::: box-note
**Process scattering**

Process (or rule) scattering is the scenario by which a process coexists in multiple levels of the language.

::: box-tip
**Process scattering (revised)**

Process scattering is the scenario by which two versions of the same process coexist in the language, either in the same level or in consecutive levels.

## (C) Process scattering hypothesis

**Partial mediation** (vowel has a direct and mediated effect on duration)

## Hypotheses

![](images/vdur-dags-3.png){fig-align="center"}

<br>

\(a\) Full mediation.

\(b\) No mediation.

\(c\) Partial mediation.

## Methods

::: box-note
-   Pre-existing data: <https://osf.io/xdgfz/>.

-   19 speakers of Northwestern Italian (Verbano-Cusio-Ossola).

-   CVCo words (mostly nonce, some real), in 5 frame sentences.

    -   C = /p, t, k/, all permutations.

    -   V = /a, e, i, ɔ, u/.
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
-   Vowel duration: from appearance of F2/3 to disappearance of F2/3.

-   F1/F2 measurements from [FastTrack](https://github.com/santiagobarreda/FastTrack) (Barreda 2021).
:::

. . .

::: box-note
-   Causal Inference (McElreath 2019).

-   Bayesian models fitted with [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) (Bürkner 2017, 2018, 2021) in R (R Core Team 2024).
:::

## Hypotheses (rep.)

::: box-warning
In a model with vowel and F1 as predictors:

-   \(a\) Full mediation

    -   The effect of vowel should be (practically) 0.

-   \(b\) No mediation

    -   The effect of F1 should be (practically) 0.

-   \(c\) Partial mediation

    -   The effect of both vowel and F1 should not be (practically) 0.
:::

## Results

![](images/bms1-pred-plot-ms-hz.png){fig-align="center"}

## Interpretation

::: box-note
-   There is a **robust effect of F1** and the effect is **non-linear**.

    -   Negative up to 400 Hz, positive from 450 Hz.

-   There is a **robust effect of vowel**.

    -   F1 alone is not sufficient to explain vowel duration.
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
**The results are compatible with the (c) Partial Mediation hypothesis (Process Scattering).**
:::

. . .

::: box-note
This means that:

-   Each vowel must have its **own duration target**.

-   Within each vowel category, **distance to target further modulates duration**.
